This is a real time construction and management simulation game.  You're goal is to keep the colonists alive and grow the population to %WIN_POPULATION_AMOUNT% individuals before the generation ship arrives at the destination planet.

To grow the population you'll need to provide more food, water and shelter at the very least.  But people have other needs too such as clothing, medical care, places to work, education and recreation.  All of this is produced or provided by structures.

[center][u][b]Structures[/b][/u][/center]


The following is a list of structures that you can build and what they provide.

[table=2]
[cell][img]res://assets/images/ui/icons/Start-Tile_icon.png[/img] [/cell]
[cell]Universal Utility Conduit (UUC) - This structure forms the foundation of all other structures.  It provides all the utility connections required such as power, water, sewage and transporation tunneling.  You can build this structure separately, but it is not required.  By itself it offers a cheap way to connect parts of the colony.

[cell][img]res://assets/images/ui/icons/Power_Reactor_icon.png[/img] [/cell]
[cell]Power Station - provides power to structures.  It can only generate so much power but can supply power to any connected structure.  A structure that is completely isolated from power will become not produce anything which can lead to population loss.  This isolation can happen if structures between the station an a structure become damaged or are otherwise disabled.[/cell]

[cell][img]res://assets/images/ui/icons/Agriculture_icon.png[/img] [/cell]
[cell]Agriculture Pod - provides food, wood and plant fibers.  People need food to live, so the number of pods affects how large a population the colony can sustain.  However, the population can withstand short periods with less food.[/cell]

[cell][/cell]
[cell][/cell]

[cell][img]res://assets/images/ui/icons/Reclaimation-Center_icon.png[/img] [/cell]
[cell]Reclamation Center - recycles materials and treats sewage and water.  The number of reclamation centers limits how much water is available.  Since people need water to live, the amount of water is a hard limit on the population.[/cell]

[cell][img]res://assets/images/ui/icons/Residence_icon.png[/img] [/cell]
[cell]Residential Complex - provides shelter.  While a population needs shelter, they can make do with overcrowding to an extent.  However, overcrowding can affect their mood and morale.[/cell]

[cell][/cell]
[cell][/cell]

[cell][img]res://assets/images/ui/icons/Medical_icon.png[/img] [/cell]
[cell]Medical Center - Provides health services.  An unhealthy population does not thrive as well as a healthy one.[/cell]

[cell][/cell]
[cell][/cell]

[cell][img]res://assets/images/ui/icons/Education_icon.png[/img] [/cell]
[cell]Education Complex - This provides education at all age levels and training for workers to run and maintain all the systems that keep the colony running. It also provides some services beyond this like building and maintaining the robotic fleet.[/cell]

[cell][/cell]
[cell][/cell]

[cell][img]res://assets/images/ui/icons/Factory_icon.png[/img] [/cell]
[cell]Factory - This highly automated facility makes all the clothing and other items for the colony.[/cell]

[cell][/cell]
[cell][/cell]

[cell][img]res://assets/images/ui/icons/Office_icon.png[/img] [/cell]
[cell]Office Complex - A place of work apart from other locations.  Also houses administration and government offices.[/cell]

[cell][img]res://assets/images/ui/icons/Recreation_icon.png[/img] [/cell]
[cell]Recreation Center - Provides entertainment and exercise for the colony.[/cell]

[/table]

[center][u][b]Construction Toolbar[/b][/u][/center]

All construction is started by clicking on a construction button.  These buttons are located at the bottom center of the screen in a horizontal toolbar configuration.  
[center][img]res://assets/images/help/ConstructionDrawer.png[/img][/center]
Simply click the button and move the mouse to the location in the colony where you want to build the structure.  Also, each structure has a shortcut for initiating their construction.  The shortcut is listed on the lower right corner of the construction button.  Using these shortcuts makes building your colony easier and faster.

The toolbar also contains a ribbon of information that is displayed when you mouse over a construction button.  This information includes the structure's full name, shortcut key, number of functioning versus total number of structures and the currently population supported versus the maximum population supported.  As structures fall into disrepair or are disabled the resource they provided will diminish and thus lower the amount of supported population.
[center][img]res://assets/images/help/ConstructionDrawer_ButtonHoverExample.png[/img][/center]
The toolbar can also be drawn out by clicking on the expand button that is located in the upper right of the toolbar.  This will reveal additional information about a structure when you mouse over a construction button such as the cost of building the structure and a description of what the structure provides.

[center][u][b]Resources[/b][/u][/center]

[table=2]
[cell][img]res://assets/images/asteroids/fragments/a10000.png[/img] [/cell]
[cell]Constructing and repairing colony structures takes resources, of which some have been supplied at launch time.  Harvest asteroid fragments that land on the moon's surface to gain more resources.  You won't be able to create a thriving colony without it.[/cell]
[/table]

[table=2]
[cell][img]res://assets/images/harvester/vehicle-assembled.png[/img] [/cell]
[cell]Resources are gathered by the harvester, an indestructible vehicle that uses it's giant drill to break up asteroid fragments to get at the ore inside.[/cell]
[cell][img]res://assets/images/ui/Drill-Deploy.png[/img] [/cell]
[cell]The harvester is deployed with the Launch Harvester button (see left).  If no fragments are on the moons surface, then the harvester won't deploy.  But once it is deployed it will continue to harvest fragments till none are left on the surface.  However, fragments may be flying around the moon and land after the harvester has decided to return to the "barn".  If this happens, simply launch the harvester again and it will continue harvesting.[/cell]
[/table]


[center][u][b]Structure Management[/b][/u][/center]
You can remove a structure from the colony to reclaim a portion of the resources it took to construct it.  You may wish to do this so that another more critical structure may be built or decided that a structure was constructed in error.  Structure can also become nonfunctional by wear and tear.  Structures need to be repaired quickly or else the population will start to suffer.  But as it costs resources to repair a structure another option is to reclaim it or leave it disabled if it's not at the moment vital.

Structures can also be disabled.  While they are disabled they require no power and so make power available for other structures on the power grid.  Disabling a non-vital structure such as Recreation Center may allow more food or water to be available and thus save lives.

[table=2]
[cell][img]res://assets/images/misc/tile_popup_menu_example.png[/img] [/cell]
[cell]To repair, disable or enable, or reclaim a structure, simply right click on the structure's tile.  A popup menu will display.  Options that are not available are disabled. See the example popup menu to the right for functioning power station tile.[/cell]
[/table]

The following are examples of what tiles look like in the listed states.

[center][u][b]Navigation[/b][/u][/center]
All navigation of the game camera is done via the mouse.  To pan or move the camera view, click and drag the left mouse button.  To zoom in the camera view, scroll the middle mouse wheel up.  To zoom out the camera view, scroll the middle mouse wheel down.  There are only 3 zoom levels, so not much scrolling is required.  As the camera zooms in it will also move towards the location of the mouse pointer.
